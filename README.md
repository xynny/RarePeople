# RarePeople - DATABRICKS ON THE BITCOIN BLOCKCHAIN
The Rarest People of them all are at Databricks.  You know this and I know this.  

# Creating a Counterparty Wallet:

If you do not have a bitcoin wallet that you control, go to https://wallet.counterwallet.io/ and create a wallet.  Write down the generation seed and keep it safe.  Once in the wallet you should have at least one bitcoin/counterparty address that looks something like 1D7ByizhvMPYHQ4UrSMS13ZJByh1XJYiVi.  This is where we trade RarePeople.
