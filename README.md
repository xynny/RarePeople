# RarePeople - DATABRICKS ON THE BITCOIN BLOCKCHAIN

The Rarest People of them all are at Databricks.  You know this and I know this.  To celebrate this fact I, Xin Lu, have released Series 1 of the RarePeople collectible cards secured by the Bitcoin blockchain.  Each card features a real RarePerson from Databricks who agreed to contribute their image and quotes and each card is a real digital asset with a limited number of copies on the bitcoin blockchain.  These cards can be traded, purchased, and sold on the Counterparty decentralized marketplace.  All transactions are mined into bitcoin blocks.  

# Getting Started:

If you do not have a bitcoin wallet that you control, go to https://wallet.counterwallet.io/ and create a wallet.  Write down the generation seed and keep it safe.  Once in the wallet you should have at least one bitcoin/counterparty address that looks something like 1D7ByizhvMPYHQ4UrSMS13ZJByh1XJYiVi.  This is where we can trade RarePeople, bitcoin, and a myriad of other tokens.  If you participated in Series 1 ask Xin to send you a copy of all these RarePeople cards!  

# Sending a Card:

If you have RarePeople assets you can go into your Counterwallet and select send and type in a bitcoin address to send the asset.  You need a small amount of bitcoin in your wallet to pay the transaction fee.

# Selling a Card on the DEX

Counterparty has a decentralized exchange at https://wallet.counterwallet.io/#pages/exchange.html .  You can list any of your cards for sale for XCP, which is the Counterparty token.  XCP can be easily exchanged into bitcoin.  

# Viewing your cards:

Clone this repo and open index.html in a browser and type in your bitcoin address.  You should be able to see what cards you own!  

# Usecases:

There are many usecases for RarePeople for any company.  Here are some:

1. Marketing - Imagine telling everyone at Spark Summit that a limited number of digital MATEI or REYNOLD cards are up for grabs.  They will be scooped up very quickly and traded.  Limited edition cards can also be released for the speakers at our conferences.  

2. Workplace verification/digital identification - RarePeople can be issued to employees as identification.  Since the blockchain is an open ledger only those who worked here would have these assets given to them and it is easily verifiable.  If a person can send out one of these special cards then it would reasonably prove that they are an employee.

3. Sprint planning - Plan your sprints in terms of how many XYNNY or MATEI you need!  It would serve as ownership and a contract.

4. Rewards - Do people actually care about highfives on whatever that system is?  Buy a card from a coworker with bitcoin as appreciation!  

AND MANY MANY MORE...
