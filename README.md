# RarePeople - DATABRICKS ON THE BITCOIN BLOCKCHAIN

The Rarest People of them all are at Databricks.  You know this and I know this.  To celebrate this fact I, Xin Lu, have released Series 1 of the RarePeople collectible cards secured by the Bitcoin blockchain.  Each card features a real RarePerson from Databricks who agreed to contribute their image and quotes and each card is a real digital asset with a limited number of copies on the bitcoin blockchain.  These cards can be traded, purchased, and sold on the Counterparty decentralized marketplace.  All transactions are mined into bitcoin blocks.  

# Getting Started:

If you do not have a bitcoin wallet that you control, go to https://wallet.counterwallet.io/ and create a wallet.  Write down the generation seed and keep it safe.  Once in the wallet you should have at least one bitcoin/counterparty address that looks something like 1D7ByizhvMPYHQ4UrSMS13ZJByh1XJYiVi.  This is where we can trade RarePeople, bitcoin, and a myriad of other tokens.  

# Viewing your cards:

Clone this repo and open index.html in a browser and type in your bitcoin address.  You should be able to see what cards you own!
